Answering 46 Simple Python Exercises

This is version 0.45 of a collection of simple Python exercises constructed (but in many cases only found and collected) by Torbjörn Lager (torbjorn.lager@ling.gu.se). 
Most of them involve characters, words and phrases, rather than numbers, and are therefore suitable for students interested in language rather than math.
